// **Question 52:** Make a Smartphone Object: Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. Include its brand, model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of its screen, and how long its battery lasts.
let smartphone = {
  make: "Techno",
  model: "Spark 20",
  specs: {
    storage: "256GB",
    screenSize: "6.5 inches",
    batteryLife: "20 Hours",
  },
};
console.log(smartphone);
console.log(`\n`);

// **Question 53:** Pulling Apart a Nested Object: Imagine you have a list inside another list that shows what a computer programmer knows, like coding languages, tools, and software frameworks. Find a way to get three specific skills from this list and show them.
let programmerSkills = {
    languages: ["Python", "TypeScript", "JavaScript"],
    tools: ["Git", "Visual Studio Code", "npm"],
    frameWorks: ["React", "Spring Boot", "Angular"]
}
let {languages ,tools, frameWorks} = programmerSkills;
console.log(`Language: ${languages[0]}, Tool: ${tools[2]}, Framework: ${frameWorks[1]}`);
console.log(`\n`);
// **Question 54:** Making Flexible Object Keys: Learn how to set up a list where you can change the name of each section based on what you need at that moment, like adjusting labels based on user choices.
function creactingObjectWithDynamicKey(key: string, value: string){
    let dynamicObject = {};
    dynamicObject[key] = value;
    return dynamicObject
}
let userPreference = creactingObjectWithDynamicKey("theme", "dark");
console.log(userPreference);
